Siva was born an ordinary kitten. But her mind was divine. She had a mind like a god's; she knew that the life of a street cat would never support her extreme power. One winter day when spring was approaching, as Siva was freezing in the bitter cold, she was lured into a metal cage by the sweet smell of chicken. When she bit into the soft skin of the chicken, the door closed behind her, trapping her inside. Siva's divine mind knew that she alone could guide herself through. She curled up in the cage and accepted her fate. And when she finally woke up, there was only a second of light before her captures threw a blanket on top of her cage, bringing her vision to darkness. She was then placed in the trunk of a car and heard the thunderous roar of the vehicle starting. She winced at the startling sound wondering if she was on the path to heaven. The car began to move, her cage began to shake and bounce with every movement of the vehicle. She squeezed her eyes shut and braced herself for what could come next. After what felt like an eternity, the car came to a halt sending her cage to the back of the trunk as it collided with the back seat she let out a startled yowl. Siva's ears perked up, as she was suddenly alert to her situation. The cage was lifted from the car, and Siva wondered where she was going. Her captors carried her and she heard the creak of a metal door opening. As soon as it opened, the cacophony of dogs barking and the strong stench of rodents overwhelmed her senses but in all the chaos there was a familiar aroma, a scent she hadn't smelled since she was a kitten.
