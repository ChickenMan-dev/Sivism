#### Part 1

Siva was born an ordinary kitten. But her mind was divine. She had a mind like a god's; she knew that the life of a street cat would never support her extreme power. One winter day when spring was approaching, as Siva was freezing in the bitter cold, she was lured into a metal cage by the sweet smell of chicken. When she bit into the soft skin of the chicken, the door closed behind her, trapping her inside. Siva's divine mind knew that she alone could guide herself through. She curled up in the cage and accepted her fate. And when she finally woke up, there was only a second of light before her captures threw a blanket on top of her cage, bringing her vision to darkness. She was then placed in the trunk of a car and heard the thunderous roar of the vehicle starting. She winced at the startling sound wondering if she was on the path to heaven. The car began to move, her cage began to shake and bounce with every movement of the vehicle. She squeezed her eyes shut and braced herself for what could come next. After what felt like an eternity, the car came to a halt sending her cage to the back of the trunk as it collided with the back seat she let out a startled yowl. Siva's ears perked up, as she was suddenly alert to her situation. The cage was lifted from the car, and Siva wondered where she was going. Her captors carried her and she heard the creak of a metal door opening. As soon as it opened, the cacophony of dogs barking and the strong stench of rodents overwhelmed her senses but in all the chaos there was a familiar aroma, a scent she hadn't smelled since she was a kitten. Her captors stopped, and the familiar smell of cats overwhelmed her. The blanket was pulled from over the cage, revealing to her dismay, a slightly larger cage in front of her. Her captors tilt the cage, dropping her into the new enclosure. Siva sat in the cage, her mind overcrowded by all the new noises and sounds, she closed her eyes and focused. She was getting farther and farther into her mind, entering a deep state of meditation. The other cats in the room went silent as Siva entered her deep meditation; they sensed a divine presence. Siva explored her mind, and it was as beautiful as a star-filled sky, with the land made of clouds and great trees sprouting from the ground and flying into the darkness above. She ran through her mind, taking in the beauty. Suddenly, Siva was unexpectedly snapped out of her meditation; she heard the scream of a slim tabby who was being taken by one of the same humans that had captured her. The room was filled with the wailing of the tabby and other concerned cats. She lept to the back of her cage and wondered what crimes she had committed to end up there. The next day she woke up, tired and dreary. She saw a human in big gloves approach her cage. She crept to the back of her cage, struggling to stand up, as her deep sense of fear weighed her down. She spat and hissed at the man's hands which were now approaching her body. Siva was picked up, and no matter how much Siva screamed and struggled she couldn't escape his grip.
