Siva was born an ordinary kitten. But her mind was divine. She had a mind like a god's; she knew that the life of a street cat would never support her extreme power. One winter day when spring was approaching, as Siva was freezing in the bitter cold, she was lured into a metal cage by the sweet smell of chicken. When she bit into the soft skin of the chicken, the door closed behind her, trapping her inside. Siva's divine mind knew that she alone could guide herself through.

The other cats in the room went silent as Siva entered her deep state of meditation, they sensed a divine presence materialize in the room. Siva explored her mind, and it was as beautiful as a star-filled sky, with the ground made of clouds and great trees sprouting from the ground and flying into the darkness above.
